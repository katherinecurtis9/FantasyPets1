<h2>Fantasy Pets</h2>
<p>
	</p>
<h3>Welcome!</h3>
	<p> Have you ever wanted a pet but you can't do the hair or don't have time for training?
	Leave that to us! We offer a variety of pets from dogs, cats, parrots and even hamsters.
	The possibilities are endless depending on what type of pet you are looking for. Do you want an energetic Lab
	or a chill Calico Cat you get to choose.
	</p>
<h3>About Us</h3>
	<p>We were founded in 2020 by Katherine Curtis when she wanted to get a pet but couldn't because she didn't have the time to train. 
	Her and her Husband came up with the idea to open Fantasy Pets that allows you to have the bet you always wanted and programmed with the personality that fits you and your family. 
	Now after 3 many successful years and many different animals we are excited with the endless possibilities.
